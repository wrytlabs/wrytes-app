# Layout

So far the layout is great. You are heading to the correct Directions.

let's extend the layout, let's have two layouts which can be loaded dynamically the idea is to parse the path from the URL and check for a certain sequence to select the layout
 e.g. /dashboard/... would load the dashboard layout. 

Rename the existing layout to example home layout

Make an example page e.g. pages/dashboard/index.tsx to show that this is working so far.
